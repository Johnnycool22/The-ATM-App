#1 Two individual Java programs have been created using Eclipse IDE. 
   The VirtualATM.java program provides options to displaying the initial balance + overdraft, withdrawal option for the three transactions £140, £50 & £90 and displays reducing balance. Final balance display negative, indicating the overdrawn condition.
   If an amount greater than balance + £100 overdraft is entered then an overdrawn alert message appears.
   The mix of notes is covered in the other program NotesType.java.

#2 NotesType.java program prompts the user with the balance and option to enter an amount. If £140, £50 or £90 is entered the denomination mix should be shown with each transaction. Program needs to be run again for each transaction.

#3 Issues: 
Getting the two programs to work as one program was challenging, tried to get class methods inherited but wasn't working correctly so decided to keep them as two java programs.
To use these two programs with Angular requires endpoints from a REST API like Springboot. To create this and successfully function would take more time to complete. (I have experience creating a SpringBoot API before using IntelliJ IDE to connect Angular 8 Frontend to MongoDB cloud database).
